# Gluten-Free-Timer
A Conventional Kitchen Timer for Gluten-Free Consumers

--------------------------------------------------------

The aim of this app is to provide a timer which includes pre-defined widely consumed foods by celiacs or people who have gluten intolerance. Celiac patients do not have variable food alternative and because of that, they have to prepare gluten-free meals. Nowadays, gluten-free food and ingredient options are increased in the market. Due to different cooking times of different products, they are supposed to use countdown timer frequently. 

In order to save time and well organize cooking process, Gluten-Free Timer is prepared. To use this app, you are only expected to touch the image of relevant product. When the time is up, you will hear the alert sound. 

In v1.0, foods are limited and you can not add custom product. As a further work; 
 - adding custom time, 
 - arranging the pre-defined foods,
 - delaying the time,
 - and changing the time during countdown
 
 will show up in v2.0.
